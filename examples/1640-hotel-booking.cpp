//Description
//A transport company often needs to deliver goods
//from one city to another city. The transport
//company has made a special deal with a hotel chain
//which allows its drivers to stay in the hotels of
//this chain for free. Drivers are only allowed to
//drive up to 10 hours a day. The transport company
//wants to find a route from the starting city to
//the destination city such that a driver can always
//spend the night in one of the hotels of the hotel
//chain, and that he needs to drive at most 10 hours
//from one hotel to the next hotel (or the
//destination). Of course, the number of days needed
//to deliver the goods should also be minimized.
